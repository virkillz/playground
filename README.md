## Story

Nevermaya is a land of over enthusiastic stray rascals. There are 6666 immortal rascals currently lived in Genesa, the capital city. They are full of energy, love to work and fight but really need someone to give them direction. That's why the kingdom need you to guide them, Chief. More importantly, the rascals need you. The ultimate goal is to have zero stray rascals in Genesa streets.

If you doing this long enough, the rascal will pledge their eternal live and loyalty for you. Technically now you own them forever, until you assign (or sell) it to other Chief. But until then, they will leave the house if you forgot to feed them.


#### What if a Rascals get away?
They will just simply wandering around Genesa. You can offer food to stray rascals and they will come to your house and stay there. Feed them long enough and they will be domisticated and be yours. If you don't like a rascals and it haven't pledge their loyalty to you, you can evict them.

## Combat Mechanics
The closest resemblence of the mechanics is Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem. You have characters you bring into party out of you character pools. Each have it's own ability like move range, strength, luck, etc. There are 2 teams and whoever lost their entire warrior first or run out of time to play wil lose.

### Combat requirement
To join a combat you must have at least 1 character and each Arena there are maximum warrior can be played. So it is possible for you to use one player against 5 player. To join a combat you must pay a fee in terms of Coin. You must submit 10 coin each player and fare. Fare is determined by the distance of your home to the arena.
